## 1. Overview

[Which entity this UI PRD covers. This document describes the standard screens and navigation flows for this entity. Complex action workflows with their own sub-PRDs define their own UI — this document covers the entity's core views and simple action UI.]

[Extracted from the Entity Base PRD — the fields, statuses, and simple actions relevant to the UI. Provides enough context for Claude Code to implement without loading the Entity Base PRD.]
