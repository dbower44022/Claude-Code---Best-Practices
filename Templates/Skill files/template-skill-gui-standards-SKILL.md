# GUI Standards

This skill provides the project's UI design system. Load it whenever you're
building or modifying user interface components.

For the complete specification, see [gui-standards-reference.md](gui-standards-reference.md).

## Key Rules (always apply)

<!-- Replace these placeholders with your project's actual UI rules. -->
<!-- These are the rules Claude Code must follow for every UI task. -->
<!-- Keep this section short — it's loaded into context first. -->
<!-- The full specification in gui-standards-reference.md is loaded on demand. -->

- [Your primary font and spacing grid, e.g., "Inter font, 4px spacing grid"]
- [Your component architecture pattern, e.g., "Props-first data flow with composable components"]
- [Your loading state rule, e.g., "Immediate loading states — never show empty screens"]
- [Your theme rule, e.g., "Support both light and dark modes"]
- [Your animation policy, e.g., "No animations or visual flourishes"]
- [Your density preference, e.g., "Compact spacing — information density over whitespace"]
