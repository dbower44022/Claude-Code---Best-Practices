# CRMExtender Glossary

Use these terms exactly as defined. Do not invent synonyms or abbreviations.
When the glossary defines a term (e.g., "Action Panel" not "sidebar",
"Entity Bar" not "nav rail", "Content Panel" not "main area"), use the
glossary term in code, comments, UI labels, and documentation.

For the complete term list, see [glossary.md](glossary.md).
