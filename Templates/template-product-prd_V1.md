## 1. Product Vision

[What is this product? What problem does it solve? What makes it different from existing solutions? This should be a clear, compelling statement that anyone can read and understand the product's purpose.]

---

## 2. Competitive Landscape

[What existing solutions address this problem? What are their strengths and weaknesses? Why do they fall short? Entity and action PRDs may reference specific competitors for detailed examples of what to do or not to do.]

---

## 3. Target Users

[Who is this product for? Define personas with their key needs and pain points. Keep descriptions at the high level — detailed user stories belong in entity and action PRDs.]

### 3.1 [Persona Name]

[Description, role, key needs, pain points.]

### 3.2 [Persona Name]

[Description, role, key needs, pain points.]

---

## 4. Product Scope

[The complete map of the product. Enumerate all entities, briefly describe each, and describe how they relate at a high level. Each entity points to its Entity Base PRD. Format is the author's choice — written description, diagram, or both.]

### 4.1 Entity Map

[List every entity with a one-sentence description of its purpose.]

### 4.2 Entity Relationships

[Describe the high-level relationships between entities. How does each entity connect to others?]

---

## 5. Product Principles

[Non-negotiable requirements that apply across the entire system. These inform every entity and action PRD without needing to be repeated in each one.]

[Examples: offline capability, audit trails, multi-tenancy, privacy compliance, event sourcing, data portability.]
