# [Entity/Action Name] — TDD

**Version:** [X.X]
**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Status:** [Draft | Review | Approved]
**Scope:** [Entity | Action]
**Parent Document:** [Entity Base PRD or Action Sub-PRD filename]
**Product TDD:** [filename]

## 1. Overview

[Brief description of why this TDD exists. What technical decisions specific to this entity or action are not covered by the Product TDD? This document is only created when needed — when the entity or action requires technology or deployment decisions that deviate from or extend the product-level defaults.]

This is a living document. Decisions are recorded here as they are made — both by the product/architecture owner and by Claude Code during implementation. When Claude Code makes an implementation decision not covered here, it should add the decision with rationale to the appropriate section.

## 2. [Decision Category]

[Group related decisions under a meaningful category heading. Common categories for entity TDDs include: Read Model Table, Identifier Model, Caching Strategy, Event Sourcing, Index Strategy. Use whatever categories fit the entity or action.]

### 2.1 [Decision Title]

**Decision:** [What was decided.]

**Rationale:** [Why this choice was made.]

**Alternatives Rejected:**
- [Alternative] — [Why it was rejected.]
- [Alternative] — [Why it was rejected.]

**Constraints/Tradeoffs:** [What limitations were accepted.]

### 2.2 [Decision Title]

[Additional decisions in the same category follow the same format.]

---

## 3. [Additional Decision Categories]

[Add category sections as needed. Each category groups related technical decisions. All decisions follow the same Decision / Rationale / Alternatives Rejected / Constraints format.]

---

## [N]. Decisions to Be Added by Claude Code

The following areas will require technical decisions during implementation that should be documented here by Claude Code:

- **[Area]:** [What decisions are anticipated and why they can't be made yet.]
- **[Area]:** [What decisions are anticipated and why they can't be made yet.]
- **[Area]:** [What decisions are anticipated and why they can't be made yet.]

[This section serves as a roadmap for Claude Code. As each area is resolved during implementation, Claude Code should move the decision out of this list and into a proper numbered section above, using the standard decision format with rationale. New anticipated decisions can be added to this list as they are identified.]
